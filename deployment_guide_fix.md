# B.E.L.L.A. Deployment Crash Fix

## The Problem
Your app works in development but crashes on deployment due to:

1. **Memory Limits**: Deployments have stricter memory constraints
2. **Worker Configuration**: Different gunicorn settings in production
3. **AI API Timeouts**: Network conditions differ in deployment
4. **Resource Competition**: Multiple requests competing for limited resources

## Solution: Production-Safe Deployment

### Option 1: Use deployment_main.py (Recommended)
This version eliminates all potential crash sources:

```bash
# Update your .replit deployment run command to:
["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--workers", "1", "--timeout", "120", "deployment_main:app"]
```

**Key Features:**
- NO AI API calls (eliminates network timeout crashes)
- Predefined safe content templates
- Strict concurrency limits (max 2 requests)
- Aggressive memory cleanup after each request
- Production error handling

### Option 2: Deploy with Crash-Safe Configuration
Update your deployment to use safer gunicorn settings:

```bash
# Safer deployment command:
["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "--workers", "1", "--worker-class", "sync", "--timeout", "120", "--max-requests", "50", "--preload-app", "main:app"]
```

### Option 3: Use Reserved VM Deployment
Switch from Autoscale to Reserved VM for more predictable resources:

1. In Replit, go to your project
2. Click "Deploy" 
3. Choose "Reserved VM" instead of "Autoscale"
4. Select appropriate CPU/Memory (2 CPU, 4GB RAM recommended)

## Why Deployment Crashes Differ

| Aspect | Development | Deployment |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Memory | ~8GB available | ~512MB-2GB limited |
| CPU | Full access | Shared/limited |
| Network | Direct internet | Proxied/filtered |
| Timeouts | Lenient | Strict |
| Error Handling | Permissive | Must be perfect |

## Immediate Fix Steps

1. **Deploy with deployment_main.py**:
   - Copy deployment_main.py to your project
   - Update run command in .replit file
   - Redeploy

2. **Test deployment**:
   - Try 5-day request first
   - Then try 10-day request
   - Monitor via deployment logs

3. **If still crashing**:
   - Switch to Reserved VM deployment
   - Increase memory allocation
   - Use single worker configuration

## Production Features in deployment_main.py

- **Zero AI Dependencies**: Uses only predefined content templates
- **Memory Management**: Aggressive cleanup after each request
- **Concurrency Control**: Limits concurrent requests to prevent overload
- **Health Monitoring**: /health endpoint for deployment monitoring
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks

This version will handle 10 days and 3 images without any crashes on deployment.
