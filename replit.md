# Overview

Salon Suite Digital Studio's B.E.L.L.A. (Beauty Engagement & Leads Launch Assistant) is an AI-powered Flask web application that generates social media content calendars for beauty businesses. Where beauty meets brilliance in digital marketing, B.E.L.L.A. helps small business owners confidently market themselves without the overwhelm using just three simple inputs: niche, city, and days.

B.E.L.L.A. is a flagship tool developed by Salon Suite Digital Studio.
